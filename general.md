## FAQs & Common Queries
1. What does DeTrip offer?
DeTrip is a travel platform offering services such as hotel bookings, flights (coming soon), and other travel-related options.

2. What’s the difference compared to traditional OTAs (online travel agencies) like Booking.com and Airbnb?

Compared to traditional Web2 OTAs, we use the same hotel providers, airlines, etc., so your experience will be the same. The difference is that our platform is built natively on blockchain and integrates cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, into its backbone, making the booking experience more transparent, secure (privacy-focused), and affordable. DeTrip doesn’t just encourage spending while traveling; it also helps you save money and maximize the value of your wallet!

3. Why blockchain and cryptocurrency?

For more details, please check our whitepaper. In summary, we use cryptocurrency and blockchain to make international payments faster with lower fees, to protect your personal data through anonymous booking with Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP), to reduce commission fees through a fair voting mechanism, and to unlock the potential of reward points, making them real assets (cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin).

4. Will there be a token?

Yes, the $TRIP token will be the utility token of DeTrip. It will primarily be distributed as a reward to our users, and you can use it to pay for future bookings, sell it on the secondary market, vote on community decisions, or hold it to enjoy various platform privileges.

5. Can I list my properties on your platform?

Not yet. We are currently working on the BnB feature, which will empower property owners and local businesses to list their own rooms and local experience services. Stay tuned!

6. I don’t have crypto. Can I still make a booking with DeTrip?

Yes, you can still pay with a credit card, Apple Pay, WeChat Pay, Alipay, and other major payment methods. However, we encourage you to explore the Web3 features, which will introduce you to a completely new world of possibilities.
